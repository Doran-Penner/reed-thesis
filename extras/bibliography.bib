	abstract = {Reliability at massive scale is one of the biggest challenges we
	            face at Amazon.com, one of the largest e-commerce operations in
	            the world; even the slightest outage has significant financial
	            consequences and impacts customer trust. The Amazon.com platform,
	            which provides services for many web sites worldwide, is
	            implemented on top of an infrastructure of tens of thousands of
	            servers and network components located in many datacenters around
	            the world. At this scale, small and large components fail
	            continuously and the way persistent state is managed in the face
	            of these failures drives the reliability and scalability of the
	            software systems.This paper presents the design and
	            implementation of Dynamo, a highly available key-value storage
	            system that some of Amazon's core services use to provide an "
	            always-on" experience. To achieve this level of availability,
	            Dynamo sacrifices consistency under certain failure scenarios. It
	            makes extensive use of object versioning and application-assisted
	            conflict resolution in a manner that provides a novel interface
	            for developers to use.},

	abstract = {The concept of one event happening before another in a
	            distributed system is examined, and is shown to define a partial
	            ordering of the events. A distributed algorithm is given for
	            synchronizing a system of logical clocks which can be used to
	            totally order the events. The use of the total ordering is
	            illustrated with a method for solving synchronization problems.
	            The algorithm is then specialized for synchronizing physical
	            clocks, and a bound is derived on how far out of synchrony the
	            clocks can become.},
