# Introduction

Quick intro and overview of the thesis before we get into proper background. Look, I did stuff! Blah blah blah, quick overview, what I learned and contributed. Anything else useful to know, e.g. how advanced I expect my reader to be.

## Distributed systems

We conceptually cover the problem space of distributed systems, consistency, and motivate with some real-world examples like collaborative document editing.

## CRDTs and stuff

Their use (motivated by above), cool things that MST did, and some things that could be improved (motivating my work).

## What I did

Not sure yet! Some MST-like structures for other data types, perhaps. And what if the payloads aren't exactly CRDTs, or they need to be manually "flattened" into a final form? (These notes are for me btw.)

## Other info

...not sure what else to put in the intro, but we'll have a better idea once more has been written.

Note: (idk where to put this but) we are not focusing on explicit consensus protocols or anything like that. So no blockchain-style agreeing on the "true" ordering of events.

Assumptions of the reader (up to change):

- introductory formal math (basic set theory, what $\mathbb{R}$ is, formal proofs)
- introductory computer science? (what does this mean)
