# Introduction

Welcome! Here is where I introduce what I'm doing.

## Distributed systems

We conceptually cover the problem space of distributed systems, consistency, and motivate with some real-world examples like collaborative document editing.

## What I did

Not sure yet! Some MST-like structures for other data types, perhaps. And what if the payloads aren't exactly CRDTs, or they need to be manually "flattened" into a final form? (These notes are for me btw.)

## Other info

...not sure what else to put in the intro, but we'll have a better idea once more has been written.
