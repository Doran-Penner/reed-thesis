# Existing content-addressed CRDTs

More specific background, e.g. MST and MerDag.

## Merkle Search Tree

Anyways, explain the Merkle Search Tree paper. (Maybe use Dolt's version and prove those properties?) Do a ton of explaining and walk-through. Drive the main point: it's a key-value search tree that efficiently stores diffs. Talk about how this relates to state-based CRDTs, delta-CRDTs, and a nice way to represent it all if we use this content-addressing thing.

## Merkle-DAG

There's also a ton here to talk about! Explain the Merkle-DAG and how it represents the Lamport time partial order. Then follow the paper as they use it to have timestamp payloads as well as each node itself having a CRDT.

Perhaps talk about the issues this paper mentions at the end? Or save that for later.

## The juicy questions

Look, we have these cool content-addressed structures! They let us do CRDT things and their structure can encode all the CRDT semantics/info we need (like tree of operations/states/etc). So.... _what else can we do with this?_

### Stick 'em together

Use the DAG and each payload is an MST. Heavy state-based has a cost of state duplication normally, but not if those states are already deduplicated like MSTs!

(Note: I need to formalize the merged nodes, shouldn't be hard but I gotta do it.)

### Other MST-like stuff

MSTs provide a structure-sharing key-value map. Can we do this kind of thing for other complex/container types? Think list, tree, dag, graph, string, etc. If we can just make a list we still get JSON! (MST for dict, new thing for list and maybe string, direct hash for int float bool etc.) That's a cool checkpoint.

### Blockchain stuff

A bunch of problems brought up at the end of the Merkle-CRDT paper are related to blockchain issues like having to keep the whole history. We could go down the blockchain path and talk about how to solve these issues.

### Storing "conflicts"

I have an idea for storing "application-level" conflicts with this structure sharing system, but I can't quite put it to words now.
Not sure if this actually requires special work or if we just talk about it as a special (and useful) case of e.g. `dag[str]` for line-level pijul conflicts.
Anyways that's another thing we could do.
