# Background

General background on distributed systems, cap theorem, lamport, crdts, and so on.

Note: should CRDTs go here or in the "specific" background? Or their own section somewhere in-between?

## Distributed systems

What is the problem and what are we trying to do? What are some common themes and issues?

### CAP theorem

Explain it, also maybe some issues/disputes with the common understanding.

### Time is unreliable

Time issues, partial order, lamport clocks.

### Other stuff

Should I talk about hashing and other "misc" background here? Could turn this into a general background chapter, with two rough sections (misc background and distributed systems). Or that can be explained when it comes up.

## CRDTs

Here we explain what a CRDT is.

### The goal

eventual consistency and optimistic replication to dodge the CAP problem.

### State-based

Join semilattice (don't need to use that term), least upper bound on everything.

Examples!

### Op-based

Commutative operations mean we can just pass the operations around.

Examples!

### Compare and contrast

More examples and comparisons, lean heavily on 2011 paper. Focus on difficulties with both: op needs strong comms and/or infinite history, state needs to keep growing somehow.

Somehow mention delta-crdts and variations on the two classic types of crdt.

### Problems

(Maybe this part goes in the above section, but whatever)

Both common versions have tradeoffs in terms of space, communication, expressiveness

What about a tree? Briefly explain the tree move, talk about the issues that that faces.

Note it is difficult (perhaps impossible) to always resolve things in a way that the end-user desires. And more complicated data types have more complicated semantics.

## Data structures

Maybe explain B-tree here? Maybe blend this with below? Anyways.

## Hashing and content addressing

TODO use notes

### Merkle background

Maybe explain Merkle trees? Or is this where I should explain hashing? I'm not sure.
