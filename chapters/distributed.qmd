# Distributed systems

What is the problem and what are we trying to do? What are some common themes and issues?

## CAP theorem

Explain it, also maybe some issues/disputes with the common understanding.

## Time is unreliable

Time issues, partial order, lamport clocks.

## Other stuff

Should I talk about hashing and other "misc" background here? Could turn this into a general background chapter, with two rough sections (misc background and distributed systems). Or that can be explained when it comes up.
