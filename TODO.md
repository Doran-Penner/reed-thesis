What to do first? Some maintenance before I even start writing.

=== Remove Sam stuff
- His actual main content
- Baked-in stuff like the Samasaur1 github link
- Change title, author, etc
- Address his README? At the least, overwrite it

=== File cleanup
- Formatter
- Nix file changes
- Move the abstract etc to better folders
- Direnv
- License?
- Whatever github/keep-tex/etc workflow I want for feedback
